                Thesis Title: Enhancing Winter Wheat Crop Yield Predictions: A Data-Driven, Incremental, and Integrative Approach with Machine Learning.

                Solved multi-modality data problem by designing and implementing innovative ML model architectures to improve winter wheat crop yield predictions.

                Effectively designed and implemented novel ML model architecture (Error-stabilised LSTM model) for multimodal datasets (combining static and dynamic data) with applications in agriculture for winter wheat crop yield prediction. It improved crop yield prediction accuracy by 30% compared to classical models. 

                Further enhanced this accuracy by integrating the error-stabilised LSTM model with a weighted ML model to handle extreme yield values in agroclimatic indices data, achieving an overall accuracy improvement of 41% with the final neural meta model.

                Conducted scalability tests that demonstrated near-linear performance in time taken and memory consumption with increasing dataset sizes, confirming model scalability for large-scale applications.
