                    The <b>aim</b> of this project is to create a button and use this button – its context, interaction, and appearance – to represent a person through their personality or character traits. This should be easily recognizable and should delight them.

                        <p>Starting with a breadth of ideas for sketches, I did <b>two interviews</b> with students in our class. My first interviewee, Zach, told me a lot about how he was an avid traveler, had gone to many countries in his youth, but when I asked him about what he considered home, he said he wasn’t really certain. After further questioning on this line, which I found particularly revealing about his character, he said he could make a home anywhere he was. One of my sketches for him was inspired by this, with <b>a bird as the button on a canvas of a world map</b> that had marked the places he had been in his life, anything you would click the bird, it would fly to another location on the map that Zach had been. Another of my favourites from those sketches were about how he was so organized and compartmentalized everything, and it was an image of him with <b>a thought bubble that was divided into sections of things that made up his life</b>; when you click on him, they would get reorganized in the bubble.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <img width="600px" style="float:right;padding:10px;" src="/images/sketches-aaron.jpg">

                        <p>My second interviewee, Aaron, told me a lot about how much he loved games – board games, video games, any kind – and avidly collected them. Further more, he was also interested in game theory and strategy, and also was a fixer upper when it came to trucks and cars and general repairs. I used this to come up with a lot of ideas for him. My top favourites were a button that when you clicked on it, would disappear and reappear somewhere else, so it would be <b>a game of “catch the button”</b>, and another idea was the button as <b>a chess queen</b>, which when pressed, the background would change to different board games – the queen would be on a snakes and ladders game, then a catan board, etc.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <img height="300px" style="float:right;padding:10px;" src="/images/sketches-famous.jpg">
                        <img height="300px" style="float:right;padding:10px;" src="/images/sketches-other.jpg">
                        
                        <p>I also did some sketching on celebrities and fictional characters, such as Harry Potter, Donald Trump, Bill Nye, Steve Irwin, and Hackerman (do memes count?). These are pretty typical: a snitch you have to catch for Harry, a nuke button for Donald, crocodile catching for Irwin, etc., but were really fun to make!</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>After getting feedback on my sketches from the group and from the class, I discarded most of the sketches for the celebrities and fictional characters, because they were too baity and didn't really try hard to get at the character of these people, rather focussing on their obvious external traits. I think the sketches I did for the interviews were the most interesting and representative of character.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>After the class feedback, as a group we decided to follow the sketch of <b>the button as the process of making a Jackson Pollock painting</b>. The canvas would be the "button" in this case, and a Pollock-style painting could be made on it. This was a really interesting concept and the class was really curious about it. Furthermore, it took the representation of a celebrity to a deeper level, <b>representing them through their art is the rawest form of their character</b>. Having <b>to interact with Pollock's "button" through experiment by making one's own painting evokes his character as a man for whom the process is as important as the art and as one obsessed with experimentation</b> - and it is a concept so meta it would delight him.</b> </p>
