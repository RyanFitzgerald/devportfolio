                    <p>We decided to implement Michaela's idea of giving girls pockets, but not just that - also charging your phone while they're at it. The idea is a mobile pocket that can be attached on the inside of clothes. When the phone is put in the pocket, the phone starts charging. <blockquote>However, we wanted to make that exciting and make people question <b>their relationship with technology</b> by using LED lights pulsing towards the phone from another location on the body. This makes the body and the technology seem connected, and asks the question: where is the power coming from?</blockquote> The team iterated on different ways to realize this relationship using fashion. We wanted a design that showcased and even focussed on an exposed circuitry aesthetic in order to ask these questions about technology.</p>

                                    My first refined sketch is the idea of the food chain. We eat food that powers us up and then that power is used in our technology. When the phone is plugged in, the lights travel from the throat of the person to the stomach and they build up there one by one until the stomach is full. Then they disappear altogether as if they've all passed into the phone. This makes us question whether we're putting our energy to good use.</li>
                                <li>
                                    My second refined sketch is the idea of the conversion of energy. The lights travel up from our feet, converting kinetic energy to potential energy. It's a play on "potential energy": where does that potential go? how much potential does technology have?
                                </li>

                                        The LED pattern is a circuit that makes a meaningful pattern of lights as if part of a system of electronics. It asks: isn't the body also a series of circuits?
                                        Some of the circuit based patterns Michaela looked at was a double helix pattern (what are we made of?) and a golden ratio spiral (what is beautiful?).

                                His next design was lights spiralled where the pocket is actually held up on the back of the neck. Another design is where the pocket itself glows when it's charging, pulsing to let the person know.</p>

                            <p>We decided on a design that used a cloth sleeve to hold the phone with a sensor inside that was activated when a phone was inserted. This will serve as a fake "connection" that allows the Arduino to charge the phone; it will serve as a proof-of-concept, since we don't have any connectors currently that would allow this. We have a power bank that charges the Arduino, and ideally this fake connection will allow the power in the Arduino to charge the phone. </p>
                            <br><p>This pocket would house the electronics of the stitch kit. The wiring of the LED would be exposed to create the circuitry aesthetic of the design. </p>
                            <br><p>Our input is the button that gets pressed when the phone enters the pocket. We initially used a resistor but that wasn't giving us consistent results. Our output was the lights that pulsed from an external point towards the phone.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The sleeve is a neutral colour, and thin so that it can fit into any pocket, but it is also made from a stretchy material because girls need pockets for lots of things with different sizes!</li>
                                <li>A flattish power bank on the back of the pocket so that it is easy to fit. A clip on the top so that it can attach on the inside of a skirt or jeans if need be.</li>
                                <li>What we decided was to make the wire malleable so the user can shape it to <b>express their relationship with technology however they want</b>. The primary design was the spiral that contained the human torso and ended at the spine back of the user so it is as if the human's brain is powering the phone. We liked this because it asks opposing questions: how does technology free human intelligence to create change? is technology taking power away from us?</li>
                                <li>The light pattern must flow from the end of the LED into the phone so that the question can be asked: what exactly powers our technology?</li>
                                <li>The end of the LEDs is also a plug, which implies that it plugs "into" something. We also made it end with small plugs that branch out so it makes you think about how technology connects to the things around it.</li>
                                <li>We chose to make the LED lights blue because it is the perceived colour of electricity and power.</li>
                                <li>We chose a LED light pattern that fades in and out quickly so it imitates blood running through veins, to suggest that people and technology are part of the same family of life. </li>
                            </ul>

                    I worked on the light pattern that that fades in and out and hooking up the sensor code with the light code so that it works like a toggle initiated by the press of the phone in the pocket, turning the lights on and off. I also filmed and edited the video for this project (and had way too much fun doing it)!
